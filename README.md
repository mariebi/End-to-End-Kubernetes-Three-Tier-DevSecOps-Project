Project Introduction:
Welcome to the End-to-End DevSecOps Kubernetes Project guide! In this comprehensive project, we will walk through the process of setting up a robust Three-Tier architecture on AWS using Kubernetes, DevOps best practices, and security measures. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in deploying, securing, and monitoring a scalable application environment.

Project Overview:
In this project, we will cover the following key aspects:

IAM User Setup: Create an IAM user on AWS with the necessary permissions to facilitate deployment and management activities.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use Terraform and AWS CLI to set up the Jenkins server (EC2 instance) on AWS.
Jenkins Server Configuration: Install and configure essential tools on the Jenkins server, including Jenkins itself, Docker, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, AWS CLI, and Trivy.
EKS Cluster Deployment: Utilize eksctl commands to create an Amazon EKS cluster, a managed Kubernetes service on AWS.
Load Balancer Configuration: Configure AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the EKS cluster.
Amazon ECR Repositories: Create private repositories for both frontend and backend Docker images on Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
ArgoCD Installation: Install and set up ArgoCD for continuous delivery and GitOps.
Sonarqube Integration: Integrate Sonarqube for code quality analysis in the DevSecOps pipeline.
Jenkins Pipelines: Create Jenkins pipelines for deploying backend and frontend code to the EKS cluster.
Monitoring Setup: Implement monitoring for the EKS cluster using Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana.
ArgoCD Application Deployment: Use ArgoCD to deploy the Three-Tier application, including database, backend, frontend, and ingress components.
DNS Configuration: Configure DNS settings to make the application accessible via custom subdomains.
Data Persistence: Implement persistent volume and persistent volume claims for database pods to ensure data persistence.
Conclusion and Monitoring: Conclude the project by summarizing key achievements and monitoring the EKS cluster‚Äôs performance using Grafana.
Prerequisites:
Before starting the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create resources.
Terraform and AWS CLI installed on your local machine.
Basic familiarity with Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, and DevOps principles.
Step 1: We need to create an IAM user and generate the AWS Access key
Create a new IAM User on AWS and give it to the AdministratorAccess for testing purposes (not recommended for your Organization's Projects)

Go to the AWS IAM Service and click on Users.


Click on Create user


Provide the name to your user and click on Next.


Select the Attach policies directly option and search for AdministratorAccess then select it.

Click on the Next.


Click on Create user


Now, Select your created user then click on Security credentials and generate access key by clicking on Create access key.


Select the Command Line Interface (CLI) then select the checkmark for the confirmation and click on Next.


Provide the Description and click on the Create access key.


Here, you will see that you got the credentials and also you can download the CSV file for the future.


Step 2: We will install Terraform & AWS CLI to deploy our Jenkins Server(EC2) on AWS.
Install & Configure Terraform and AWS CLI on your local machine to create Jenkins Server on AWS Cloud

Terraform Installation Script

wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg - dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install terraform -y
AWSCLI Installation Script

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
sudo apt install unzip -y
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
Now, Configure both the tools

Configure Terraform

Edit the file /etc/environment using the below command add the highlighted lines and add your keys in the blur space.

sudo vim /etc/environment

After doing the changes, restart your machine to reflect the changes of your environment variables.

Configure AWS CLI

Run the below command, and add your keys

aws configure

Step 3: Deploy the Jenkins Server(EC2) using Terraform
Clone the Git repository- https://github.com/AmanPathak-DevOps/End-to-End-Kubernetes-Three-Tier-DevSecOps-Project

Navigate to the Jenkins-Server-TF

Do some modifications to the backend.tf file such as changing the bucket name and dynamodb table(make sure you have created both manually on AWS Cloud).


Now, you have to replace the Pem File name as you have some other name for your Pem file. To provide the Pem file name that is already created on AWS


Initialize the backend by running the below command

terraform init

Run the below command to check the syntax error

terraform validate

Run the below command to get the blueprint of what kind of AWS services will be created.

terraform plan -var-file=variables.tfvars

Now, run the below command to create the infrastructure on AWS Cloud which will take 3 to 4 minutes maximum

terraform apply -var-file=variables.tfvars --auto-approve

Now, connect to your Jenkins-Server by clicking on Connect.


Copy the ssh command and paste it on your local machine.


Step 4: Configure the Jenkins
Now, we logged into our Jenkins server.


We have installed some services such as Jenkins, Docker, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, AWS CLI, and Trivy.

Let‚Äôs validate whether all our installed or not.

jenkins --version
docker --version
docker ps
terraform --version
kubectl version
aws --version
trivy --version
eksctl --version


Now, we have to configure Jenkins. So, copy the public IP of your Jenkins Server and paste it on your favorite browser with an 8080 port.


Click on Install suggested plugins


The plugins will be installed


After installing the plugins, continue as admin


Click on Save and Finish


Click on Start using Jenkins


The Jenkins Dashboard will look like the below snippet


Step 5: We will deploy the EKS Cluster using eksctl commands
Now, go back to your Jenkins Server terminal and configure the AWS.


Go to Manage Jenkins

Click on Plugins


Select the Available plugins install the following plugins and click on Install

AWS Credentials

Pipeline: AWS Steps


Once, both the plugins are installed, restart your Jenkins service by checking the Restart Jenkins option.


Login to your Jenkins Server Again


Now, we have to set our AWS credentials on Jenkins

Go to Manage Plugins and click on Credentials


Click on global.


Select AWS Credentials as Kind and add the ID same as shown in the below snippet except for your AWS Access Key & Secret Access key and click on Create.


The Credentials will look like the below snippet.


Now, We need to add GitHub credentials as well because currently, my repository is Private.

This thing, I am performing this because in Industry Projects your repository will be private.

So, add the username and personal access token of your GitHub account.


Both credentials will look like this.


Create an eks cluster using the below commands.

eksctl create cluster --name Three-Tier-K8s-EKS-Cluster --region us-east-1 --node-type t2.medium --nodes-min 2 --nodes-max 2
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name Three-Tier-K8s-EKS-Cluster

Once your cluster is created, you can validate whether your nodes are ready or not by the below command

kubectl get nodes

Step 6: Now, we will configure the Load Balancer on our EKS because our application will have an ingress controller.
Download the policy for the LoadBalancer prerequisite.

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.5.4/docs/install/iam_policy.json

Create the IAM policy using the below command

aws iam create-policy --policy-name AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy --policy-document file://iam_policy.json

Create OIDC Provider

eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region=us-east-1 --cluster=Three-Tier-K8s-EKS-Cluster --approve

Create a Service Account by using below command and replace your account ID with your one

eksctl create iamserviceaccount --cluster=Three-Tier-K8s-EKS-Cluster --namespace=kube-system --name=aws-load-balancer-controller --role-name AmazonEKSLoadBalancerControllerRole --attach-policy-arn=arn:aws:iam::<your_account_id>:policy/AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy --approve --region=us-east-1

Run the below command to deploy the AWS Load Balancer Controller

sudo snap install helm --classic
helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
helm repo update eks
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller -n kube-system --set clusterName=my-cluster --set serviceAccount.create=false --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer-controller
After 2 minutes, run the command below to check whether your pods are running or not.

kubectl get deployment -n kube-system aws-load-balancer-controller

If the pods are getting Error or CrashLoopBackOff, then use the below command

helm upgrade -i aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller \
  --set clusterName=<cluster-name> \
  --set serviceAccount.create=false \
  --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer-controller \
  --set region=us-west-1 --set vpcId=<vpc#> -n kube-system
Step 7: We need to create Amazon ECR Private Repositories for both Tiers (Frontend & Backend)
Click on Create repository


Select the Private option to provide the repository and click on Save.


Do the same for the backend repository and click on Save


Now, we have set up our ECR Private Repository and


Now, we need to configure ECR locally because we have to upload our images to Amazon ECR.

Copy the 1st command for login


Now, run the copied command on your Jenkins Server.


Step 8: Install & Configure ArgoCD
We will be deploying our application on a three-tier namespace. To do that, we will create a three-tier namespace on EKS

kubectl create namespace three-tier

As you know, Our two ECR repositories are private. So, when we try to push images to the ECR Repos it will give us the error Imagepullerror.

To get rid of this error, we will create a secret for our ECR Repo by the below command and then, we will add this secret to the deployment file.

Note: The Secrets are coming from the .docker/config.json file which is created while login the ECR in the earlier steps

kubectl create secret generic ecr-registry-secret \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=${HOME}/.docker/config.json \
  --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson --namespace three-tier
kubectl get secrets -n three-tier

Now, we will install argoCD.

To do that, create a separate namespace for it and apply the argocd configuration for installation.

kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.4.7/manifests/install.yaml

All pods must be running, to validate run the below command

kubectl get pods -n argocd

Now, expose the argoCD server as LoadBalancer using the below command

kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'

You can validate whether the Load Balancer is created or not by going to the AWS Console


To access the argoCD, copy the LoadBalancer DNS and hit on your favorite browser.

You will get a warning like the below snippet.

Click on Advanced.


Click on the below link which is appearing under Hide advanced


Now, we need to get the password for our argoCD server to perform the deployment.

To do that, we have a pre-requisite which is jq. Install it by the command below.

sudo apt install jq -y

export ARGOCD_SERVER='kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd -o json | jq - raw-output '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname''
export ARGO_PWD='kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d'
echo $ARGO_PWD

Enter the username and password in argoCD and click on SIGN IN.


Here is our ArgoCD Dashboard.


Step 9: Now, we have to configure Sonarqube for our DevSecOps Pipeline
To do that, copy your Jenkins Server public IP and paste it on your favorite browser with a 9000 port

The username and password will be admin

Click on Log In.


Update the password


Click on Administration then Security, and select Users


Click on Update tokens


Click on Generate


Copy the token keep it somewhere safe and click on Done.


Now, we have to configure webhooks for quality checks.

Click on Administration then, Configuration and select Webhooks


Click on Create


Provide the name of your project and in the URL, provide the Jenkins server public IP with port 8080 add sonarqube-webhook in the suffix, and click on Create.

http://<jenkins-server-public-ip>:8080/sonarqube-webhook/


Here, you can see the webhook.


Now, we have to create a Project for frontend code.

Click on Manually.


Provide the display name to your Project and click on Setup


Click on Locally.


Select the Use existing token and click on Continue.


Select Other and Linux as OS.

After performing the above steps, you will get the command which you can see in the below snippet.

Now, use the command in the Jenkins Frontend Pipeline where Code Quality Analysis will be performed.


Now, we have to create a Project for backend code.

Click on Create Project.


Provide the name of your project name and click on Set up.


Click on Locally.


Select the Use existing token and click on Continue.


Select Other and Linux as OS.

After performing the above steps, you will get the command which you can see in the below snippet.

Now, use the command in the Jenkins Backend Pipeline where Code Quality Analysis will be performed.


Now, we have to store the sonar credentials.

Go to Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Credentials

Select the kind as Secret text paste your token in Secret and keep other things as it is.

Click on Create


Now, we have to store the GitHub Personal access token to push the deployment file which will be modified in the pipeline itself for the ECR image.

Add GitHub credentials

Select the kind as Secret text and paste your GitHub Personal access token(not password) in Secret and keep other things as it is.

Click on Create

Note: If you haven‚Äôt generated your token then, you have it generated first then paste it into the Jenkins


Now, according to our Pipeline, we need to add an Account ID in the Jenkins credentials because of the ECR repo URI.

Select the kind as Secret text paste your AWS Account ID in Secret and keep other things as it is.

Click on Create


Now, we need to provide our ECR image name for frontend which is frontend only.

Select the kind as Secret text paste your frontend repo name in Secret and keep other things as it is.

Click on Create


Now, we need to provide our ECR image name for the backend which is backend only.

Select the kind as Secret text, paste your backend repo name in Secret, and keep other things as it is.

Click on Create


Final Snippet of all Credentials that we needed to implement this project.


Step 10: Install the required plugins and configure the plugins to deploy our Three-Tier Application
Install the following plugins by going to Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Plugins -> Available Plugins

Docker
Docker Commons
Docker Pipeline
Docker API
docker-build-step
Eclipse Temurin installer
NodeJS
OWASP Dependency-Check
SonarQube Scanner

Now, we have to configure the installed plugins.

Go to Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Tools

We are configuring jdk

Search for jdk and provide the configuration like the below snippet.


Now, we will configure the sonarqube-scanner

Search for the sonarqube scanner and provide the configuration like the below snippet.


Now, we will configure nodejs

Search for node and provide the configuration like the below snippet.


Now, we will configure the OWASP Dependency check

Search for Dependency-Check and provide the configuration like the below snippet.


Now, we will configure the docker

Search for docker and provide the configuration like the below snippet.


Now, we have to set the path for Sonarqube in Jenkins

Go to Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> System

Search for SonarQube installations

Provide the name as it is, then in the Server URL copy the sonarqube public IP (same as Jenkins) with port 9000 select the sonar token that we have added recently, and click on Apply & Save.


Now, we are ready to create our Jenkins Pipeline to deploy our Backend Code.

Go to Jenkins Dashboard

Click on New Item


Provide the name of your Pipeline and click on OK.


This is the Jenkins file to deploy the Backend Code on EKS.

Copy and paste it into the Jenkins

https://github.com/AmanPathak-DevOps/End-to-End-Kubernetes-Three-Tier-DevSecOps-Project/blob/master/Jenkins-Pipeline-Code/Jenkinsfile-Backend

Click Apply & Save.


Now, click on the build.

Our pipeline was successful after a few common mistakes.

Note: Do the changes in the Pipeline according to your project.


Now, we are ready to create our Jenkins Pipeline to deploy our Frontend Code.

Go to Jenkins Dashboard

Click on New Item

Provide the name of your Pipeline and click on OK.


This is the Jenkins file to deploy the Frontend Code on EKS.

Copy and paste it into the Jenkins

https://github.com/AmanPathak-DevOps/End-to-End-Kubernetes-Three-Tier-DevSecOps-Project/blob/master/Jenkins-Pipeline-Code/Jenkinsfile-Frontend

Click Apply & Save.


Now, click on the build.

Our pipeline was successful after a few common mistakes.

Note: Do the changes in the Pipeline according to your project.


Setup 10: We will set up the Monitoring for our EKS Cluster. We can monitor the Cluster Specifications and other necessary things.

We will achieve the monitoring using Helm
Add the prometheus repo by using the below command

helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable

Install the Prometheus

helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install grafana grafana/grafana

Now, check the service by the below command

kubectl get svc

Now, we need to access our Prometheus and Grafana consoles from outside of the cluster.

For that, we need to change the Service type from ClusterType to LoadBalancer

Edit the stable-kube-prometheus-sta-prometheus service

kubectl edit svc stable-kube-prometheus-sta-prometheus

Modification in the 48th line from ClusterType to LoadBalancer


Edit the stable-grafana service

kubectl edit svc stable-grafana

Modification in the 39th line from ClusterType to LoadBalancer


Now, if you list again the service then, you will see the LoadBalancers DNS names

kubectl get svc

You can also validate from your console.


Now, access your Prometheus Dashboard

Paste the <Prometheus-LB-DNS>:9090 in your favorite browser and you will see like this


Click on Status and select Target.

You will see a lot of Targets


Now, access your Grafana Dashboard

Copy the ALB DNS of Grafana and paste it into your favorite browser.

The username will be admin and the password will be prom-operator for your Grafana LogIn.


Now, click on Data Source


Select Prometheus


In the Connection, paste your <Prometheus-LB-DNS>:9090.


If the URL is correct, then you will see a green notification/

Click on Save & test.


Now, we will create a dashboard to visualize our Kubernetes Cluster Logs.

Click on Dashboard.


Once you click on Dashboard. You will see a lot of Kubernetes components monitoring.


Let‚Äôs try to import a type of Kubernetes Dashboard.

Click on New and select Import


Provide 6417 ID and click on Load

Note: 6417 is a unique ID from Grafana which is used to Monitor and visualize Kubernetes Data


Select the data source that you have created earlier and click on Import.


Here, you go.

You can view your Kubernetes Cluster Data.

Feel free to explore the other details of the Kubernetes Cluster.


Step 11: We will deploy our Three-Tier Application using ArgoCD.
As our repository is private. So, we need to configure the Private Repository in ArgoCD.

Click on Settings and select Repositories


Click on CONNECT REPO USING HTTPS


Now, provide the repository name where your Manifests files are present.

Provide the username and GitHub Personal Access token and click on CONNECT.


If your Connection Status is Successful it means repository connected successfully.


Now, we will create our first application which will be a database.

Click on CREATE APPLICATION.


Provide the details as it is provided in the below snippet and scroll down.


Select the same repository that you configured in the earlier step.

In the Path, provide the location where your Manifest files are presented and provide other things as shown in the below screenshot.

Click on CREATE.


While your database Application is starting to deploy, We will create an application for the backend.

Provide the details as it is provided in the below snippet and scroll down.


Select the same repository that you configured in the earlier step.

In the Path, provide the location where your Manifest files are presented and provide other things as shown in the below screenshot.

Click on CREATE.


While your backend Application is starting to deploy, We will create an application for the frontend.

Provide the details as it is provided in the below snippet and scroll down.


Select the same repository that you configured in the earlier step.

In the Path, provide the location where your Manifest files are presented and provide other things as shown in the below screenshot.

Click on CREATE.


While your frontend Application is starting to deploy, We will create an application for the ingress.

Provide the details as it is provided in the below snippet and scroll down.


Select the same repository that you configured in the earlier step.

In the Path, provide the location where your Manifest files are presented and provide other things as shown in the below screenshot.

Click on CREATE.


Once your Ingress application is deployed. It will create an Application Load Balancer

You can check out the load balancer named with k8s-three.


Now, Copy the ALB-DNS and go to your Domain Provider in my case porkbun is the domain provider.

Go to DNS and add a CNAME type with hostname backend then add your ALB in the Answer and click on Save

Note: I have created a subdomain backend.amanpathakdevops.study


You can see all 4 application deployments in the below snippet.


Now, hit your subdomain after 2 to 3 minutes in your browser to see the magic.


You can play with the application by adding the records.


You can play with the application by deleting the records.


Now, you can see your Grafana Dashboard to view the EKS data such as pods, namespace, deployments, etc.


If you want to monitor the three-tier namespace.

In the namespace, replace three-tier with another namespace.

You will see the deployments that are done by ArgoCD


This is the Ingress Application Deployment in ArgoCD


This is the Frontend Application Deployment in ArgoCD


This is the Backend Application Deployment in ArgoCD


This is the Database Application Deployment in ArgoCD


If you observe, we have configured the Persistent Volume & Persistent Volume Claim. So, if the pods get deleted then, the data won‚Äôt be lost. The Data will be stored on the host machine.

To validate it, delete both Database pods.


Now, the new pods will be started.


And Your Application won‚Äôt lose a single piece of data.


Conclusion:
In this comprehensive DevSecOps Kubernetes project, we successfully:

Established IAM user and Terraform for AWS setup.
Deployed Jenkins on AWS, configured tools, and integrated it with Sonarqube.

This is great work - hats off to you! I would strongly recommend, if you haven't already on your YouTube page, taking this entire post and turning into an instructional video. If you display this as a guided-walkthrough on a video, while lecturing how & why you did certain things, I think it would be superb.
